### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code lints.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Development Setup

1. Fork and clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/react-surprise.git
cd react-surprise
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
npm install
```

3. Start development mode
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Run the demo app
```bash
npm run demo
```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch
```bash
git checkout -b feature/my-new-feature
```

2. Make your changes and commit them
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "feat: add amazing new feature"
```

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):
- `feat:` New feature
- `fix:` Bug fix
- `docs:` Documentation only changes
- `style:` Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc)
- `refactor:` Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf:` Performance improvements
- `test:` Adding missing tests
- `chore:` Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

3. Run checks before pushing
```bash
npm run lint
npm run type-check
npm run format:check
npm run build
```

4. Push your branch and create a pull request
```bash
git push origin feature/my-new-feature
```

## Adding New Animations

To add a new animation:

1. Create a new file in `src/animations/` (e.g., `rainbows.tsx`)
2. Implement the animation following the existing pattern:

```typescript
import React from 'react';
import { AnimationConfig, Particle } from '../types';
import { randomInRange, generateId } from '../utils';

export const createRainbowParticles = (
  origin: { x: number; y: number },
  config: AnimationConfig
): Particle[] => {
  // Implementation
};

export const renderRainbowParticle = (particle: Particle): React.ReactNode => {
  // Implementation
};
```

3. Add the animation to `src/animations/index.ts`
4. Update the `AnimationType` in `src/types.ts`
5. Add documentation and examples to the README
6. Create a demo in the demo app

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code style (enforced by ESLint and Prettier)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused
- Prefer composition over inheritance

## Testing

- Write tests for new features
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting PR
- Aim for high code coverage
- Test across different browsers and devices
